<h3><strong>Why Learn C?</strong></h3>
<p class="css3-shadow">C is the most commonly used programming language for writing operating
    systems. The first operating system written in C is Unix. Not only is C the language of
    operating systems, it is the precursor and inspiration for almost all of the most popular
    high-level languages available today. In fact, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby are all written in
    C.</p>

<h3><strong>Why C, and not another language?</strong></h3>
<p class="css3-shadow">
    The primary design of C is to produce portable code while maintaining performance and minimizing
    footprint (CPU time, memory, disk I/O, etc.). C has a big codebase for low level applications.
    It is the "native" language of UNIX, which makes it flexible and portable. It is a stable and
    mature language which is unlikely to disappear for a long time and has been ported to most, if
    not all, platforms.</p>

<h3><strong>Why C should be your first language.</strong></h3>
<p class="css3-shadow">
    Nobody can learn C++ or Java directly. To master these languages you need to have a strong
    concept of programming element such as polymorphism, classes, inheritance etc. Simple question
    is how you can learn such complicated concepts when you don't even know about the basic elements
    such as block functions. C is a language which begins from scratch and it has foundational
    concepts on which today concepts stand on.It is language on which C++ is based on, hence C# also
    derive its origin from the C. Java is also a distant cousin of C and share the same programming
    concept and syntax of C. These are the most dominant languages in the world and all are based on
    C. To rock the world through them you must get rocking with C.</p>

<h3><strong>In this App</strong></h3>
<p class="css3-shadow">
    Numerous number of programs which will help you practice C as that is the foundation of the
    programming world. You can master any language if you know the basics of C.\n
    Mykitab has used a simple approach to help you with the syntax and semantics of C. Happy
    Learning!</p>
