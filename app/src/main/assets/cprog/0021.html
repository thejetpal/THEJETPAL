<h3><strong>Structure </strong></h3>
<p class="css3-shadow">
  Structure is  user defined data type, which can store the different data type variable  together</p>
<p class="css3-shadow">
  <strong><em>Syntax:</em></strong><br>
  struct  [structure tag]<br>
  {<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; member definition;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; member definition;<br>
  ...<br>
  } variables_name;</p>
<p class="css3-shadow"><strong>Example</strong><br>
  struct book<br>
  {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;&nbsp;name[50] <strong>;</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;&nbsp;author[50] <strong>;</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;&nbsp;id <strong>;</strong><br>
} b <strong>;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Union</strong></h3>
<p class="css3-shadow">
  A union is a  user defined data type that enables to store different data types in the same  memory location. We can define a union with many members,<br>but only one member  can contain a value at any given time.<br>
  The memory required to store a union variable is the memory required for largest element of an union</p>
<p class="css3-shadow"><strong><em>Syntax:</em></strong><br>
  union [union  tag]<br>
  {<br>
  member definition <strong>;</strong><br>
  member definition <strong>;</strong><br>
  ...<br>
}  variables_name <strong>;</strong></p>
<p class="css3-shadow"><strong>Example</strong><br>
  union book<br>
  {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;&nbsp;name[50] <strong>;</strong><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;&nbsp;author[50] <strong>;</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;&nbsp;id <strong>;</strong><br>
  } b <strong>;</strong></p>
